# Custom Livechat Development
## Environment Setup
More information [here](https://developer.rocket.chat/rocket.chat/rocket-chat-environment-setup/mac-osx)

- Install **Node 14.19.3** either [manually](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/) or using a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (recommended)
- Install **Meteor**: https://www.meteor.com/developers/install
- Install **yarn**: https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install
- Clone the repository and navigate into the directory

```
git clone https://github.com/HTD-Health/Rocket.Chat.git
cd Rocket.Chat
```

- Run the following commands to navigate to the meteor directory and download the necessary meteor version for Rocket.Chat, as configured in `.meteor/release` file

```
cd apps/meteor
meteor --version
```

- Back in the main directory, install all the packages by simply running

```
yarn
```

- Build and startup your development server by executing

```
yarn build
yarn dev # or yarn dsv if your system has less than 16 gigs of memory
```

When done, you should see the following printed on your terminal and the local server running on http://localhost:3000

## Livechat Customization
After changes in the livechat package, you need to build it again
```
cd packages/livechat
yarn build
```
After launching the rocket chat again, the changes should be visible.

## Docker Image Preparation
> Make sure you have the latest version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

> Remember to build the project and livechat package beforehand using `yarn build`.

> Make sure you have the correct version of node (**14.19.3**).

- Navigate to the meteor directory
```
cd apps/meteor
```
- Build the application and copy the `Dockerfile` and `compose.yml` files to the resulting directory
```
meteor build --server-only --directory /tmp/rc-build
cp .docker/Dockerfile /tmp/rc-build
cp .docker/compose.yml /tmp/rc-build
cd /tmp/rc-build
```
- You need to make sure that the resulting image works properly, so we'll use the `compose.yml` file

```
docker compose up
```

If everything went well and the terminal does not report any errors then the local server should be started on http://localhost:3000.

If you want to change the port on which the application is running, create an `.env` file with an example variable
```
HOST_PORT=8000
```
### Troubleshooting

Official Image Repository: https://github.com/RocketChat/Docker.Official.Image
#### **Bcrypt Error**
If you get errors with `bcrypt` when launching the container in the terminal, follow these steps:

- Download the official built package from the link below, where instead of `${RC_VERSION}` enter rocket chat version. 

    https://releases.rocket.chat/${RC_VERSION}/download

- Extract the `.tar` file and replace the `/npm` directory located in `bundle/programs/server/` with the directory in your resulting `/tmp/rc-build/bundle/programs/server/` directory

- Then in the `compose.yml` file add `platform: linux/x86_64` as below:

```
...

services:
  rocketchat:
    platform: linux/x86_64
    build: .
...
```

After deleting the docker image and re-running the `docker compose up` command. The application should run without errors.
